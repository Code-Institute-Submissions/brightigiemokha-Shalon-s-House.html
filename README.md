 <h1>Testing</h1>

 I used devtools device toolbar to confirm it is responsive on different screen sizes, and also used Responsive Design Checker.com to see how it looked on smaller devices.

 <p>I tested each of the links in the nav bar to make sure they linked to the correct sections.

 <p>I checked each external link linked to the correct page and that no links were broken.

 <p>I confirmed that the form works, that only first name will go in the first name box, last name in the last name box, and email address in the email box. 
 I confirmed pressing 'Submit' results in a pop up to confirm these fields need filling in, and it won't let you submit without them.

 <h2>Bugs</h2>

No known bugs have been found.

<h2>Validator Testing</h2>

<strong>HTML</strong> - Unfortunately, the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjoannalsk.github.io%2FThe-Tower-of-London%2F">W3C Validator</a> detected 24 errors and 14 warnings. 

<p>
I tried to correct some of these errors, but it resulted in my site losing its structure. Given the lack of time before the deadline, 
I felt it best not to make these changes, as it may have resulted in me unable to correct them and handing in a site with everything out of place. Other issues brought up included the forward-slash-a tags, which were marked as stray end tags. I will try to fix these errors for resubmission.

<br>
<strong>CSS</strong> - No errors were found when it was checked with the W3C Validator.
